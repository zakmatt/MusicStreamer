# MusicStreamer App
To start working with the application one should generate an authorization token `OAuth Token` from the following site: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-search-item/.  
Once you have the token, assign it in the `TOKEN` variable in the file `./MusicStreamer/Constants.swift`.

# Example usage locally
One you get logged in to your `Spotify` account click on the search bar and insert the name of a band whose songs you would like to listen to. Then, click on the song and press play.
